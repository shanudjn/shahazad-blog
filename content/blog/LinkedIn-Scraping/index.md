I know what your question will be -- Why do you want to scrape websites using Javascript? This is becuase, in software engineering, it's not about what language you choose, its more about how you can use logic to solve problems given certain constraints.

As I am learning Javascript so I decided to put a constraint on myself and try to scrape a website to solidify whatever I have learnt this past week and try to scrape LinkedIn.
